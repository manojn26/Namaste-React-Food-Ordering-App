5. Talk is cheap, show me the code :-
---------------------------------------

Comments :-
{
    //Single line Comments

    /*
    Multine line comment 
    /*
}

JSX is not mandatory.
Typescript is not mandatory
ES6 is not mandatory



JSX can only have parent element.
If we put more than one line in compoent, we hvae to wrap that in <div>
But if you dont want that, we use <React.Fragment>
<React.Fragment> comes from React.
<React.Fragment> is like a empty tag.

Instead of React.Fragment we can write <></>
<></> -> also called React.Fragment



NEVER EVER WRITE CODE WITHOUT PLANNING

React.Fragment :-
------------------
Is a Component exported by React.


Props :-
---------
Pass data through the Components.
Props - Properties

At the end of the day our functional Component is function.

function  fn(parsms){}
fn(args)


Without Destruturing :
------------------------
const Restraunt = (props)=>{
    {props.restraunt.data}
}

With Destruturing :
------------------------
const Restraunt = ({restraunt})=>{
    {props.restraunt.data}
}


<Restraunt restraunt />

Virtual DOM :-
---------------
<head>
    <body>
        <Restraunt1>
        <Restraunt2>
            <img/>
        <Restraunt3>
    </body>
</head>

-> Virtual DOM is not just a concept of React.
-> We keep a represntaton of DOM with us is known as Virtual DOM.
-> Why do we need
    - Reconciliation : 
            - is an algorithm react uses, diff algorith. to differentiate one tree from another
            - it determines what needs to change an UI, what doesnot needs change an UI
            - It doesnto reredner entire application, it will update particular piece of UI.
            it uses keys for differentiates
            - If tags are differntes it uniquely identifies.
            - But if multiple same tags, we need pass unique keys, re render everything.

HW :
    Virtual DOM
    Reconciliation
    diff algorithm
    React Fiber (new Reconciliation engine came in React 16)

-> Usually we render data from Array, we can't use key as index.


Congif Driven UI :
config driven UI; baceknd should control our data


6. Let's get Hooked :-
-----------------------
It is not necessory to any folder in our project.
But we need to wrap our code proper folder structire, that gives us better modular approach,

Two ways of exporting :-
------------------------------
export default Name;
import Name from ".../" :- Default import 

-> We cant export two or more things in default.
-> We can export only one thing in default.

export const Title = ()=>{} :- Named export
import {Title} from "../" :- Named import

export { Title }
import { Title } from "../"

export { Name1, Name2 }
import { Name1, Name2 } from "../"

export const Title = ()=>{}
export const Header = ()=>{}
import * as obj from "../"


Filenames :-
.jsx -> its because of the file contains jsx code.
We can use .jsx or .js and .ts or .tsx


When importing we can write file-extensions also.

constants.js:-
------------
Put all your hard coded things.

Input :-
--------
When we write input tag in HTML it will work normally.
But It wont work in React.

React uses one way data binding.

Whenever we need to change value in React, we need to use useState()

useState() :-
    - It returns an Array.
    - first value of the Array is variable.
    - If you want to modify the variable, you directly cant modify it.
    - We can modify that variable using function.

    - second value of the Array is function.
    - this function is used to modify the variable.

    - Now we make two way binding with these concept.

    Why do we need state variables :-
        - Every time we want our variables with sync with UI.
        - React keeps tracking the variables.

    useState() -> returns [variable name, function to update the variable]
    

- In React input doesnot work like HTML
- When we write input we need to do data  binding to it.


Hooks :-
    - Hooks are nothing its a javascript function at the end of the day.
    - These Hooks are written by Facebook Developers, The Hooks are gave some functionalities.


08 - Exploring The World :-
-----------------------------
React is very fast because of VirtualDOM, Reconciliation, Diff algorithm.

Our HTML will be in TreeStructure, 
    In React it will be in VirtualDOM.
        Whenever any changes happened in Nodes, It re-renders the TreeStructure.

    VirtualDOM :
         - Representaion of DOM
         - At the end of the day, it is kind of like Javascript Object.
         - It makes Fast DOM Manipulation. (It uses React Fiber(Diff Algorithm))
         - 

When state variables got updated, it re-renders the entire component.
